# HabiticaPomodoro
GUI Pomodoro connected to Habitica tasks

Created with the use of TKinter and Habitica API

## The Pomodoro Technique 
Get a to-do list and a timer.

Set your timer for 25 minutes, and focus on a single task until the timer rings.

When your session ends, mark off one pomodoro and record what you completed.

Then enjoy a five-minute break.

After four pomodoros, take a longer, more restorative 15-30 minute break.

## How to use:

Set a Pomodoro duration (default 25 minutes)
Click 'Start' to start the Pomodoro timer, after the Pomodoro duration a short break will start
Click 'Skip' to skip the current Pomodoro duration (if you finished earlier)
Click 'Reset' to reset the Pomodoro timer
Click 'Finish' to mark the task completed on Habitica and reset the timer

Requires 'api_keys.txt' in the same folder as the program with two lines:
1. API_USER
2. API_KEY
Those can be found on Habitica > Settings > API
